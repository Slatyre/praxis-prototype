# PRAXIS Prototype — Ecosystem (ECH)

This folder contains the **prototype implementation** of the PRAXIS Ecosystem Central Hub (ECH).
It exists to prove feasibility and interaction flow — not to define canon.

## Purpose (Prototype Goals)
- Host the **Daemon Seat UI** inside ECH
- Prove **connect / disconnect** of a reasoning model (LLM/SLM) through the daemon console
- Prove **message round-trip** (send → receive) inside PRAXIS
- Persist transcripts and events as **prototype artifacts/logs**
- Prepare the surface for later experiments (UI capture, visual twin), without implementing them yet

## Boundaries (What This Prototype Must NOT Do)
- No direct UI control from the daemon console
- No execution authority in ECH
- No “smart” automation loops
- No canonical definitions (those belong in `praxis-canonical`)

## Source of Truth
Canonical architecture, terminology, and contracts live in:
- `praxis-canonical` (GitHub)

This folder implements and tests against canon; it does not redefine it.

## Current Status
- [ ] Daemon Seat UI scaffold
- [ ] Mock adapter connect/disconnect
- [ ] Real model adapter connect/disconnect
- [ ] Transcript + event logging

## How to Work Here (Workflow)
- Use `experiment/*` branches for spikes
- Merge to `main` only when the prototype remains usable
- If a finding changes architecture or terms, write an ADR or update the glossary in `praxis-canonical`

## Next Step
Implement the **Daemon Seat Console** inside ECH with:
- Provider dropdown
- Connect/Disconnect state machine
- Chat panel + input
- Trace/event strip
